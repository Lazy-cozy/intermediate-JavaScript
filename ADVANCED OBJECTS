//The this Keyword


const robot = {
  model : '1E78V2',
  energyLevel : 100,
  provideInfo(){
    return (`I am ${this.model} and my current energy level is ${this.energyLevel}.`)}
};

console.log(robot.provideInfo());

Arrow Functions and this

// Arrow functions inherently bind, or tie, 
// an already defined this value to the function itself that is NOT the calling object. 
// the value of this is the global object, or an object that exists in the global scope,
// which doesnâ€™t have a dietType property and therefore returns undefined.
