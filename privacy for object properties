One common convention is to place an underscore _ before the name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered.


Getters

Getters can perform an action on the data when getting a property.
Getters can return different values using conditionals.
In a getter, we can access the properties of the calling object using this.
The functionality of our code is easier for other developers to understand.


const robot = {
  _model: '1E78V2',
  _energyLevel: 100,
  get energyLevel() {
    if(typeof this._energyLevel === 'number'){
        return `My current energy level is ${this._energyLevel}`
    }else{
        return 'System malfunction: cannot retrieve energy level'
    }
  }
};

console.log(robot.energyLevel);
